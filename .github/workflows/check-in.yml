  # in the past, "0 3 * * 1-5" runs at around 10:00 (UTC+7), so I changed it to "0 1 * * 1-5" to run at 08:00 (UTC+7)
  # already changed, but still late check-in at around (09:22 UTC+7)

  # Still late check-in https://github.com/helmisatria/talenta-attendance-automation/issues/5,
  # Need to change the cron to "0 0 * * 1-5" to run at around 08:00 (UTC+7)

  # changed to "20 0 * * 1-5" from "0 0 * * 1-5" expecting will run at around 08:20 (previously around 08:00)
